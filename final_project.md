# Introduction/Business Problem
When a municipality wants to know and better serve its citizens, there are many ways to do so. One of them is a survey, which involves going door to door to meet people and asking them a few prepared questions to better understand their feelings about safety, services offered by the municipality or surrounding businesses. Following this type of survey, it is necessary to define which categories of people feel the most left out in order to better target the services to be provided to the greatest number of people, and to adopt a policy accordingly.

As such, the City of Montreal conducted this type of survey in 2016. In this survey, more than 7,000 people were questioned and we are especially interested in their satisfaction with the businesses and services offered in their borough.

The final objective will be to have a recommendation of services and businesses to develop for the groups who feel the most left out by borough.

# Data
To proceed with this analysis, we will need to retrieve the data from the survey conducted by the City of Montreal (https://donnees.montreal.ca/ville-de-montreal/sondage-satisfaction-citoyens). These data will allow us to create several people clusters based on their profile (age category, number of years of study, mother tongue, etc.), their neighbourhood of residence and their level of satisfaction with the services and businesses in their borough. 

From the API foursquare, we will retrieve the list of services, stores and leisure activities in the borough.
